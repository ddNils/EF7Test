# EF7Test
This is a very basic sample of a asp.net core web app with onion architecture (EF7)

I used the MVC 6 project provided with Visual Studio 2015 (with Authorization). 

Then moved all models into separate projects (EF7Test.Core).

I wanted to test dependency injection and ef7 with identity in one project.
